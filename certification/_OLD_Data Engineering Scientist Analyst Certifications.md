# Certifications — Index (Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Analyst/BI)

This page is now an index. The full study guides were split into three role-specific documents:

## Role guides

- Data Engineer — see `data-engineer-certifications.md`
- Data Scientist (preferred) — see `data-scientist-certifications.md` (alias: `ml-ai-engineer-certifications.md`)
- Data Business Analyst (preferred) — see `data-business-analyst-certifications.md` (alias: `analyst-bi-certifications.md`)

Each guide includes: overview, assessment details, outline and weights (paraphrased from official pages), recommended training, hands‑on mapping to this repository, a short study plan, a skills checklist, quick references, and resource links (official docs and O’Reilly books).

Tip: Start from your current role or target certification. If you’re cross‑skilling, skim the other guides’ checklists and hands‑on mappings.
